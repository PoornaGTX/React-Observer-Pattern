# React Observer Pattern

## Description

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

In this example, we'll use the mitt package to demonstrate the Observer Pattern. mitt is a tiny, functional event emitter that can be used to manage events and their handlers efficiently.
